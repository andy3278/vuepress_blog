I started my blog at 2021, which is also my final year as a physics undergard at HKUST. I found myself lost, lsot at countless possible career paths, data scientist, physicist, web develope, AI, Machine Learning all that fancy stuffs. Each path seemingly having the best possible outcome, and yet each path seems to be a one way ticket. 

So I started to reflect, reflect on my University life, what makes me excited the most? what skills do i need for that career? What is my position in this world? I thought of an ancient Greek aphorism "know thyself" means know yourself, to know what is ones character in the world, aware ones limitation as a moral. I can't simply become all the careers metioned above, I need time and patience to be good at one thing, not everything.  

Then I come to a realization that what matter the most isn't skills or eperience, but to have the courage to make changes, changes that puts you toward your goal. 

I was once stuck in middle of a cross road, being indecision then i started to write blog, idea can be writen is good idea, writing things down helps me clear my mind and forces me focus on one thing and only one thing at a time. 

Right now I am ready to start my journey, and I know it is never too late to startðŸš€.
